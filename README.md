----audio analyzer using neopixels----
I modified the code of the "Holiday Lights and Sounds" proyect from Jeremy Blum
http://www.jeremyblum.com/2011/12/25/tutorial-14-for-arduino-holiday-lights-and-sounds/
and I used the same amplifier circuit from that project, but I used an audio isolator transformer 
for each audio channel, so I wouldn't get noise on the speakers
